# THE POKEMON GAME

### This is a text-based Pokemon game implemented in Java. In this game, players can choose their characters and Pokemon to battle against each other. Each character has a strategy power, and each Pokemon has a unique superpower. The battle takes place in different weather conditions, which can impact the damage dealt during the fight.
